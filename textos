feat(auth): Configure OWIN authentication middleware with OIDC and cookies  

- Implemented OWIN authentication pipeline using OpenID Connect (OIDC).  
- Added `UseCookieAuthentication` to manage user sessions with cookies.  
- Configured `LoginPath` to `/Auth/Login.aspx` for redirecting unauthenticated users.  
- Set `ExpireTimeSpan` to 30 minutes to enhance session security.  
- Ensured `SignInAsAuthenticationType` is properly set to prevent OWIN middleware order issues.  

This update improves authentication flow by integrating OIDC with cookie-based authentication in the OWIN pipeline.  

Today, I’m continuing the OIDC implementation in ESOP. I’ll probably deploy to the development environment today for testing.
