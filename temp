I'm exploring the possibility of implementing OIDC in a Web Forms app with .NET Framework 4.7.2. The usual approach from .NET Core doesn’t work because .NET Framework doesn’t support OIDC directly, so I’m using OWIN. I set up a local OIDC test server and a test app to authenticate. Still working on it.

OWIN is a way to handle authentication and other middleware in .NET Framework. I’m using it because the usual OIDC approach from .NET Core doesn’t work in Web Forms.
